                    Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney formed a formidable partnership at Manchester United, combining
                    Ronaldo's flair and Rooney's tenacity to dominate English football. Despite a brief on-field
                    controversy during the 2006 World Cup, their friendship endured, and together they won multiple
                    trophies, including the Premier League and UEFA Champions League.
